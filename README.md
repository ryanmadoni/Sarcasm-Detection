# Sarcasm-Detection
Sarcasm Detection using an Ensemble of 15 BERT and DistilBERT models implemented using PyTortch using the Kaggle data set found here:
https://www.kaggle.com/danofer/sarcasm.  Different model architectures, comment lengths, and context were compared and contrasted to see how the affected the detection of sarcasm.

Over 80% accuracy was achieved on the testing set and lost accuracy is partially accredited to the quality of the data set, which has multiple issues discussed in the paper.
